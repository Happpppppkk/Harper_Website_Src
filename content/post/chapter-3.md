title: "MNIST Dataset: Digit Recognizer"
---
MNIST ("Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology") is the de facto “Hello World” dataset of computer vision. Since its release in 1999, this classic dataset of handwritten images has served as the basis for benchmarking classification algorithms. As new machine learning techniques emerge, MNIST remains a reliable resource for researchers and learners alike.

This study focuses on the application of deep learning techniques using TensorFlow and Keras frameworks. The dataset is splited into training and test set for evaluations. The enriched model with six layers outperformed the initial three-layer model with accuracy of 97.5%.
