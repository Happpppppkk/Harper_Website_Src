title: "House Price EDA and Price Prediction "
---
In the rapidly evolving field of real estate, predicting house prices accurately can be a challenging endeavor. This study aims to build a predictive model for house prices using a dataset containing various housing attributes. Starting with an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA), the research revealed pertinent insights about the dataset, including missing values, feature distributions, and their inter-correlations. Key preprocessing steps, such as feature engineering and imputation, were undertaken to refine the dataset for modeling. Several regression models, including Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, and Elastic Net, were employed and fine-tuned to achieve optimal performance. In addition, robust feature selection methods, such as Sequential Feature Selector (SFS) and L1 Regularization, were utilized to enhance model efficiency. Preliminary results, assessed using metrics like the Mean Squared Error (MSE) and r2 score, indicate varying performance across models. This project not only sheds light on the influential factors determining house prices but also provides a framework for building and refining predictive models in the real estate domain.
